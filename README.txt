Enhanced Choice
-------- ------

The enhanced choice activity module enables a teacher to ask a single question and offer a selection of possible 
media rich responses.

As with the "Choice" module upon which this plug-in is based, results may be published after students have answered, 
after a certain date, or not at all. Results may be published with student names or anonymously.

An enhanced choice activity may be used

* As a quick poll to stimulate thinking about a topic
* To quickly test students\' understanding
* To facilitate student decision-making, for example allowing students to vote on a direction for the course
